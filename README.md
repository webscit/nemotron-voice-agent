Nemotron Voice Agent Blueprint provides a comprehensive, end-to-end voice agent built with open NVIDIA Nemotron models and NVIDIA NIM for acceleration and scaling. It is designed to guide developers through the creation of a cascaded pipeline, integrating Nemotron ASR, LLM, and TTS, while solving for the complexities of streaming, interruptible conversations. Clone it, swap in your own logic, and deploy a working voice AI prototype in hours.

Built on the open-source [Pipecat framework](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) and leveraging NVIDIA NIM microservices, this example helps teams accelerate the deployment of high-performance voice AI solutions.

## ✨ Why this blueprint

- **Sub-second E2E latency**: sub-second end-to-end latency with support for multiple concurrent streams, designed for production scale.
- **Fully open models**: Nemotron Streaming and Parakeet ASR, Magpie TTS and Nemotron LLM models. Swap any component, self-host, no lock-in.
- **Interruption Handling**: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and End-of-Utterance (EOU) logic to guide the agent on exactly when to start and stop speaking, ensuring a natural conversational flow.
- **Multilingual Capabilities**: native support for multiple languages provided by NVIDIA Magpie TTS and Multilingual ASR.
- **Multimodal Understanding**: reason over speech and vision together, analyzing live camera input and uploaded media (images, documents) within a single conversation, powered by Nemotron Omni.
- **Multi-Agent and Tool Calling**: orchestrate cooperating agents that invoke external tools and functions for task-oriented workflows, while decoupling reasoning from response generation for lower perceived latency.
- **Voice Agent Builder Skill**: quickly scaffold and refine cascaded or Omni voice agents from scratch with NVIDIA models using Pipecat or LiveKit.
- **Edge Support**: deploy anywhere, from cloud and workstation to DGX Spark and edge devices like Jetson Thor, using self-contained deployment recipes.
- **OpenAI Realtime–compatible gateway**: `WS /v1/realtime` alongside RTVI `/api/ws`. See [Use the Realtime Gateway](docs/how-to/use-realtime-gateway.md).

## 🧪 Examples

Each example showcases a **pattern** for building a voice pipeline. Start from the one closest to your use case and adapt it. Follow each example's own README (linked below) for its architecture, supported recipes, configuration, and tunables.

| Example | Description | When to use | Supported Deployment Profiles |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| [Generic Assistant](src/examples/generic/README.md) | Baseline **English-only** cascaded pipeline with Nemotron ASR, Nemotron LLM, and Magpie TTS. | Best for getting started and prototyping, before tailoring to a specific domain. | Cloud, Server (workstation), Single GPU (workstation, DGX Spark, Jetson Thor) |
| [Multilingual Assistant](src/examples/multilingual/README.md) | Cascaded pipeline using **Multilingual ASR and TTS**, with a fixed language per session for better reliability. | Use for non-English and multi-language voice agents. | Cloud, Server (workstation), Single GPU (workstation, DGX Spark, Jetson Thor) |
| [Nemotron Omni Assistant](src/examples/omni_assistant/README.md) | Cascaded pipeline using **Nemotron Omni**, where a single model replaces the ASR + LLM stages and Magpie TTS speaks the reply. | Comparing a cascaded ASR + LLM + TTS pipeline against an Omni-based one. | Cloud, Server (workstation), Single GPU (workstation, DGX Spark, Jetson Thor) |
| [Nemotron Omni Assistant Subagents](src/examples/omni_assistant_subagents/README.md) | Multi-agent **Nemotron Omni** pipeline where specialized agents add audio/video and live-webcam understanding while the voice loop stays responsive. | Recommended for multimodal inputs, giving a richer experience across image, audio, video, and webcam. | Cloud, Server (workstation), Single GPU (workstation, DGX Spark) |
| [Frontend/Backend Agent](src/examples/frontend_backend_agent/README.md) | A fast frontend LLM handles the conversation while a specialized backend agent does the work. This is the pattern for giving an **existing text / agentic backend** a real-time conversational experience (the flight-booking agent as the reference backend). | Add voice to an existing text agent / agentic backend with minimal changes. | Cloud, Server (workstation), Single GPU (workstation, DGX Spark, Jetson Thor) |

> **Note:** The listed deployment profiles are what ship in the default configs, not a hard limit. Each linked example README lists its default models by profile. The examples can be extended with other hardware configurations or models. Those configurations are not included by default.

## 📋 Requirements

These are the minimum requirements, and support varies by example and deployment profile. See the [Examples](#-examples) table for what runs where, and each example's README plus the [LLM](docs/how-to/configure-llm.md) / [ASR](docs/how-to/configure-asr.md) / [TTS](docs/how-to/configure-tts.md) Services docs for exact models and corresponding VRAM usage.

### Hardware Requirements

| Deployment Profile | Hardware | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Cloud | CPU only (no GPU) | Model endpoints from NVIDIA cloud APIs (NVCF). |
| Server | NVIDIA GPU workstation. GPU count and memory depend on the selected models and scale. | Scaling-oriented NIM deployment. DGX Spark and Jetson Thor are not supported for this profile. Default all-on-one-GPU layout is about 80 GB. Size it using the [NIM support matrix and LLM sizing guide](docs/how-to/configure-llm.md#vram--hardware-support). |
| Performance Server | Four-GPU Blackwell workstation | `generic-assistant/server-perf` load benchmark only, not a browser UI session. |
| Single GPU | 1 workstation GPU, DGX Spark, or Jetson Thor | Uses the universal `*/single-gpu` recipes. Nemotron 3.5 Lightning workstations need at least 28 GiB usable VRAM. Jetson Thor requires JetPack 7.0. Orin is not supported. Follow the [LLM sizing guide](docs/how-to/configure-llm.md#vram--hardware-support) and, when applicable, the [Jetson Thor guide](docs/03-jetson-thor.md). |

### Software Requirements

Credentials depend on the deployment profile. Do not mix them.

- **Cloud, Server, and Performance Server**: an **NVIDIA API Key** (`NVIDIA_API_KEY`) from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/). Server (`*/server`) and Performance Server (`generic-assistant/server-perf`) also need valid **NVIDIA NGC** credentials to pull NIM container images (refer to the [NGC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-overview/index.html#registering-activating-ngc-account)) and a `docker login nvcr.io`.
- **Single GPU**: a **Hugging Face token** (`HF_TOKEN`) for model downloads and NVIDIA driver 580.x or newer for NeMo-Speech.cpp. It does not require `NVIDIA_API_KEY` or authentication with `docker login nvcr.io`.
- **Docker**: Docker Compose v2.20 or newer. Cloud needs Docker only. Server, Performance Server, and Single GPU also need Docker with NVIDIA GPU support ([NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Deploy with the bundled **agent skills** (recommended), or follow the manual steps below. In below steps, we deploy the **Generic Assistant on a workstation GPU**. For other examples or deployment profiles, see the [Examples](#-examples) table and each example's README. For a Jetson Thor quickstart on the `*/single-gpu` recipes, follow the [Jetson Thor guide](docs/03-jetson-thor.md).

### With the agent skills

Install the skills, then ask your coding agent to deploy or configure your chosen example:

```bash
npx skills add .
```

### Manual steps

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and copy the example environment file only if `.env` does not exist.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/nemotron-voice-agent.git
    cd nemotron-voice-agent
    test -f .env || cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Set `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in `.env`. This Quick Start uses the Server profile, which requires that key (the same key is required for cloud-only and `generic-assistant/server-perf`). Single-GPU uses `HF_TOKEN` instead. Docker Compose passes values from this file into the application and model services.

3. Log in to the NVIDIA NGC Docker Registry (required for Server and Performance Server; skip for cloud-only and Single-GPU).

    ```bash
    set -a; . ./.env; set +a
    printf '%s' "$NVIDIA_API_KEY" | docker login nvcr.io -u '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
    ```

4. Deploy the Generic Assistant on a local workstation GPU (about 80 GB VRAM for the default all-on-one-GPU NIM layout). NIM selects a compatible LLM profile automatically:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile generic-assistant/server up -d
    ```

    > **Note:** Deployment may take 30-60 minutes on first run. This runs the Generic Cascaded pipeline with local NIM ASR, LLM, and TTS sidecars. On local recipes, the **first voice interaction** may have higher latency while GPU sidecars warm up. Later turns are much faster. If you have one supported GPU but not enough memory for the NIM server layout, use `--profile generic-assistant/single-gpu` and follow the [single-GPU setup](docs/01-getting-started.md#docker-based-deployment). If you have no local GPU, run the cloud profile `--profile generic-assistant`.

5. Access the application at `https://<machine-ip>:7860`. Keep TLS enabled when testing the browser UI.

    - **TLS:** HTTPS is the default, because browser microphone and WebRTC require a secure context. `PIPELINE_TLS=false` serves plain HTTP for headless/API testing. See [plain-HTTP deployment and usage](docs/06-troubleshooting.md#browser-access) in Troubleshooting.
    - **Remote access:** clients on a different network may need a TURN server. See [Enable a TURN Server](docs/how-to/enable-turn-server.md).
    - **Audio:** use a headset (preferably wired) for the best experience.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/01-getting-started.md). For common startup issues, see [Troubleshooting](docs/06-troubleshooting.md).
