# Configuration Guide

This is the index of everything you can configure in the Nemotron Voice Agent. Configuration lives in a small set of example-local files plus root `.env` settings, and the sections below index each area. For how the catalog files (`services.cloud.yaml` / `services.local.yaml`) work, see [Configure Services](how-to/configure-services.md).

## Model Service

What ASR / LLM / TTS models are available, their VRAM, precision, and known issues:

| Reference | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| [Configure LLM](how-to/configure-llm.md) | Nemotron LLM models, reasoning on/off, GPU sizing & precision |
| [Configure ASR](how-to/configure-asr.md) | ASR models, VRAM, hardware support, Domain Adaptation & endpointing |
| [Configure TTS](how-to/configure-tts.md) | TTS models, VRAM, hardware support, voice selection, pronunciation (IPA), and text filters |

## Welcome Message

When a client connects, the bot greets the user and introduces itself before the user speaks. Disable the welcome message to have the bot wait for the user instead. This behavior applies to the Generic, Multilingual, Omni, Omni Assistant Subagents, and Frontend/Backend Agent examples.

- **Per example (backend-only):** set `welcome_message: false` on an example in [`examples_registry.yaml`](../examples_registry.yaml). The default is `true` when the key is omitted.
- **Global override:** set `ENABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE` in `.env`. When set, `ENABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE` overrides every example's registry value. For example, the `generic-assistant/server-perf` profile uses it to disable the greeting.

```yaml
# examples_registry.yaml: keep one example quiet until the user speaks
examples:
  generic-assistant:
    welcome_message: false
```

While the welcome message is enabled, the user is muted until the bot finishes its opening turn (`MuteUntilFirstBotCompleteUserMuteStrategy`), which prevents interruption. When you disable the welcome message, the pipeline removes that mute strategy because there is no first bot turn. The user is unmuted immediately.

## Performance tuning

Pipeline tuning knobs (smart turn, chat-history window, audio buffering, transport) live in [Tune Pipeline Performance](how-to/tune-pipeline-performance.md). For benchmark results, see [Evaluation and Performance](04-evaluation-and-performance.md).
