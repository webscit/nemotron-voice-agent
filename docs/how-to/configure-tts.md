# Configure TTS

The pipeline synthesizes the spoken reply with a streaming **TTS** service. The default is NVIDIA **Magpie TTS Multilingual**, served from the cloud (NVIDIA-hosted NVCF endpoints) or self-hosted next to the pipeline as an [**NVIDIA NIM for Speech**](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/index.html) sidecar.

TTS services are declared per example in `services.cloud.yaml` (remote / NVCF) and `services.local.yaml` (Compose-managed sidecars). This page is the **model reference and configuration guide**: available models, how to size them, and how to set voices, pronunciation, and text filtering. For catalog mechanics (switching, adding, and overriding services), see [Configure Services](configure-services.md).

## Models

| Model | Catalog key | Self-hosted compose service | Modelcard |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| **Magpie TTS Multilingual**: default, streaming multilingual TTS with per-language voices | `magpie-multilingual-tts` | [`docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml) | [model card](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-multilingual/modelcard) |
| **Magpie TTS Zeroshot**: multilingual streaming TTS that supports zero-shot voice cloning and includes built-in female and male voices | `magpie-zeroshot-tts` | [`docker-compose.magpie-zeroshot-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.magpie-zeroshot-tts.yaml) | [model card](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-zeroshot/modelcard) |
| **Chatterbox TTS Multilingual**: alternate streaming multilingual TTS | `chatterbox-multilingual-tts` | [`docker-compose.chatterbox-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.chatterbox-tts.yaml) | [model card](https://build.nvidia.com/resembleai/chatterbox-multilingual-tts/modelcard) |

> Magpie Multilingual is the registry default and the TTS sidecar started by local recipes. Chatterbox and Magpie Zeroshot are opt-in: select their catalog key in the Services tab (or `defaults.tts` in [`examples_registry.yaml`](../../examples_registry.yaml)). For local NIM, also enable the matching Compose profile (see [Hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements-and-deployment-configs)).

Voice IDs follow each model's naming. For example, use `Magpie-Multilingual.EN-US.Aria`, `Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Female`, or `Chatterbox-Multilingual.en-US.Male`. The available voices and emotions depend on the deployed NIM. Refer to [available voices and emotions](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/voices.html).

### Supported Languages

The client discovers the active TTS service's available voices and language codes at runtime. Treat this table as model-level guidance, because exact availability can vary by endpoint, deployment profile, and selected NIM image.

For the multilingual assistant, this is **TTS-only** coverage, not the final session-language list. Voice Settings shows only the intersection of the selected ASR, TTS, and built-in LLM capabilities. For example, a Chatterbox deployment can advertise Arabic or Greek voices, but those locales are not available with the built-in Nemotron 3.5 Lightning or Nemotron 3 Super LLMs. See [Configure LLM](configure-llm.md#multilingual-session-languages).

| Model | Supported languages |
| --- | --- |
| [Magpie TTS Multilingual](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/reference/support-matrix/tts.html#magpie-tts-multilingual) | English (`en-US`) · Spanish (`es-US`) · French (`fr-FR`) · German (`de-DE`) · Italian (`it-IT`) · Vietnamese (`vi-VN`) · Mandarin (`zh-CN`) · Hindi (`hi-IN`) · Japanese (`ja-JP`) · Modern Standard Arabic (`ar-XA`) · Korean (`ko-KR`) · Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`) |
| [Magpie TTS Zeroshot](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-zeroshot/modelcard) | English (`en-US`) · Spanish (`es-US`) · French (`fr-FR`) · German (`de-DE`) · Mandarin (`zh-CN`) · Vietnamese (`vi-VN`) · Italian (`it-IT`) · Hindi (`hi-IN`) · Japanese (`ja-JP`) · Modern Standard Arabic (`ar-XA`) · Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`) · Korean (`ko-KR`) |
| [Chatterbox TTS Multilingual](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/reference/support-matrix/tts.html#chatterbox-tts-multilingual) | Arabic (`ar-SA`) · Danish (`da-DK`) · German (`de-DE`) · Greek (`el-GR`) · English (`en-US`) · Spanish (`es-ES`) · Finnish (`fi-FI`) · French (`fr-FR`) · Hebrew (`he-IL`) · Hindi (`hi-IN`) · Italian (`it-IT`) · Japanese (`ja-JP`) · Korean (`ko-KR`) · Malay (`ms-MY`) · Dutch (`nl-NL`) · Norwegian (`nb-NO`) · Polish (`pl-PL`) · Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`) · Russian (`ru-RU`) · Swedish (`sv-SE`) · Swahili (`sw-KE`) · Turkish (`tr-TR`) · Mandarin (`zh-CN`) |

For NVIDIA's current model and deployment support details, see the [TTS support matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/reference/support-matrix/tts.html).

> The active default per slot is set in [`examples_registry.yaml`](../../examples_registry.yaml) (`defaults`).
>
> **Streaming only.** The real-time pipeline needs a **streaming** TTS model. The streaming-capable TTS NIMs are **Magpie TTS Multilingual**, **Magpie TTS Zeroshot**, and **Chatterbox TTS Multilingual**. Check the [Pipecat NVIDIA TTS service](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/src/pipecat/services/nvidia/tts.py) for supported request fields and model-specific options.

## Hardware Requirements and Deployment Configs

TTS runs one of these ways, and the repo wires the right one per profile:

- **Cloud (NVCF)**: no local GPU. Magpie Multilingual and Chatterbox appear in the Services tab (no Compose change). Magpie Zeroshot has no cloud function.
- **Magpie TTS Multilingual (default server recipe)**: started by `*/server` recipes as `magpie-multilingual-tts-service` ([`docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml)). Universal `*/single-gpu` recipes use NeMo-Speech.cpp.
- **Opt-in local TTS (Chatterbox or Magpie Zeroshot)**: both are listed in Compose but do **not** start with the default recipe. They share Magpie Multilingual's host ports (`50151` / `9000`), so only one of Magpie Multilingual, Chatterbox, or Zeroshot can run at a time. Enable the opt-in profile and scale Magpie off:

  | Alternate | Compose profile | Catalog key | Compose file |
  |-----------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
  | Chatterbox | `chatterbox-tts` | `chatterbox-multilingual-tts` | [`docker-compose.chatterbox-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.chatterbox-tts.yaml) |
  | Magpie Zeroshot | `magpie-zeroshot-tts` | `magpie-zeroshot-tts` | [`docker-compose.magpie-zeroshot-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.magpie-zeroshot-tts.yaml) |

  ```bash
  # Example: Magpie Zeroshot on the server recipe (same pattern for Chatterbox)
  docker compose --profile generic-assistant/server --profile magpie-zeroshot-tts \
    up -d --scale magpie-multilingual-tts-service=0
  ```

  Then select the matching catalog key in the Services tab (or `defaults.tts`). Omitting the opt-in profile leaves that sidecar running and holding the ports—stop it before Magpie Multilingual can bind again (`docker compose --profile <profile> stop <service>`, then recipe `up -d`).

  Magpie Zeroshot NGC access is restricted — apply at the [Magpie TTS Zeroshot NGC page](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nim/teams/nvidia/containers/magpie-tts-zeroshot). For audio-prompt cloning, see [Voice cloning / zero-shot](#voice-cloning--zero-shot).
- **NeMo-Speech.cpp (single GPU, including Jetson Thor)**: on `*/single-gpu`, an on-device sidecar serves Magpie TTS from local GGUF weights: `nemo-speech` / `nemo-speech-multilingual` (ASR + TTS together) or `nemo-speech-tts` (TTS only, for Omni). `scripts/download-nemo-speech-models.sh` also fetches Sparrowhawk TN grammars so digits and dates are spoken as words (`--tts.tn-model-dir=/models/tn_configs`). The v0.1.0 grammar archive covers only English and French. For other languages, refer to [Text Normalization](#text-normalization). See [Jetson Thor](../03-jetson-thor.md).

### VRAM & Hardware Support

| Model | Typical VRAM | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Magpie TTS Multilingual | **12.58 GiB** GPU / 5.182 GiB host memory at `batch_size=8` | Can share a single ~80 GB GPU with ASR (~15 GB) and the LLM (~30 GB FP8). Split across GPUs with `device_ids` in [`docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.magpie-tts.yaml). See [Configure LLM → VRAM & hardware support](configure-llm.md#vram--hardware-support). |
| Magpie TTS Zeroshot | **13.06 GB** GPU / 4.00 GB CPU memory at `batch_size=8` | The default Compose selector is `name=magpie-tts-zeroshot,batch_size=8`. This profile fits the shared H100 layout when Magpie Multilingual is scaled off. |
| Chatterbox TTS | **44.61 GiB** GPU / 4.86 GiB host memory at `batch_size=8` | The default Compose selector is `name=chatterbox-tts-multilingual,batch_size=8` on GPU `0`. This profile supports A100 80 GB, H100, L40S, and DGX Spark. The A100 40 GB variant does not have enough memory. Chatterbox does **not** fit the Magpie single-80-GB shared layout with LLM + ASR. |

### Performance & Scaling

`batch_size` is the main TTS throughput knob (`NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR`):

#### Magpie TTS Multilingual 1.10.0

| `batch_size` | GPU memory | Host memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `8` (default) | 12.58 GiB | 5.182 GiB |
| `32` | 41.46 GiB | 5.208 GiB |
| `64` | 74.74 GiB | 5.258 GiB |

The standard Compose service selects `batch_size=8`. The `generic-assistant/server-perf` profile selects `batch_size=64` on a dedicated GPU.

#### Magpie TTS Zeroshot 1.2.0

| `batch_size` | GPU memory | CPU memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `8` (default) | 13.06 GB | 4.00 GB |
| `32` | 41.30 GB | 7.08 GB |

The Compose service selects `batch_size=8`. Use `batch_size=32` only on a dedicated GPU because it does not fit the shared H100 layout.

#### Chatterbox TTS Multilingual 1.1.0

| `batch_size` | GPU memory | Host memory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `8` (default) | 44.61 GiB | 4.86 GiB |
| `32` | 46.84 GiB | 5.40 GiB |
| `64` | 49.72 GiB | 5.54 GiB |

The Compose service selects `batch_size=8`. A100 80 GB, H100, and L40S support all three profiles. The A100 40 GB variant does not have enough memory for any profile. DGX Spark supports only `batch_size=8`.

For first-chunk and inter-chunk latency and throughput (RTFX) across GPUs, refer to the **[TTS performance benchmarks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/reference/performances/tts/performance.html)**. For end-to-end pipeline latency (TTS time-to-first-byte) in this blueprint, refer to [Evaluation and Performance](../04-evaluation-and-performance.md).

## Customization

### Voices & Emotions

The active voice is the `voice_id` in the catalog entry. The client UI includes a voice selector that discovers the connected service's available voices and languages, so you can switch mid-session. Voice IDs follow each model's naming. For example, use `Magpie-Multilingual.EN-US.Aria`, `Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Female`, or `Chatterbox-Multilingual.en-US.Male`. Available voices and emotions depend on the deployed NIM and can be discovered at runtime over gRPC or HTTP. Refer to [available voices and emotions](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/voices.html).

- **Magpie Multilingual**: multiple voices and emotional styles per locale.
- **Magpie Zeroshot**: languages listed in [Supported languages](#supported-languages); built-in voices across locales are `Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Female` (default) and `Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Male` ([model card](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/magpie-tts-zeroshot/modelcard)).
- **Chatterbox**: **one default speaker per locale**.

To change the **default**, edit `voice_id` in the example's `services.cloud.yaml` / `services.local.yaml`. For a local Magpie NIM, point the entry at the sidecar (`magpie-multilingual-tts-service:50051` or `magpie-zeroshot-tts-service:50051`) under the active recipe section. See [Configure Services](configure-services.md).

```yaml
tts:
  magpie-multilingual-tts:
    name: "Magpie TTS Multilingual"
    server: "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"   # cloud. Local entries use the sidecar host:port (e.g. magpie-multilingual-tts-service:50051)
    voice_id: "Magpie-Multilingual.EN-US.Aria"
    model: "magpie-tts-multilingual"
    function_id: "877104f7-e885-42b9-8de8-f6e4c6303969"
    synthesis_mode: stitched

  chatterbox-multilingual-tts:
    name: "Chatterbox TTS Multilingual"
    server: "grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443"
    voice_id: "Chatterbox-Multilingual.en-US.Male"
    model: "chatterbox-tts-multilingual"
    function_id: "ddacc747-1269-4fab-bfd9-8f593dead106"
    synthesis_mode: per_sentence

  # Local only. No cloud function_id.
  magpie-zeroshot-tts:
    name: "Magpie TTS Zeroshot"
    server: "magpie-zeroshot-tts-service:50051"
    voice_id: "Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Female"
    model: "magpie-tts-zeroshot"
    function_id: ""
    synthesis_mode: stitched
    language_code: en-US
    # optional voice cloning:
    # zero_shot_audio_prompt_file: "/path/to/prompt.wav"
```

The catalog hydrates the required `model` and `function_id` fields and the optional `zero_shot_audio_prompt_file` field into the session, then passes them to Pipecat's `NvidiaTTSService`.

### Synthesis Mode

Pipecat's `NvidiaTTSService` supports two synthesis modes through the catalog field `synthesis_mode`:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `stitched` | Reuse one Magpie `SynthesizeOnline` stream across sentences in a reply (smoother multi-sentence audio). Requires Pipecat `>=1.5.0`, plus Magpie TTS Multilingual `>=1.7.0` or Magpie TTS Zeroshot `>=1.2.0`. |
| `per_sentence` | Open a fresh synthesis call per sentence. Safe for models without cross-sentence stitching. |

Set `synthesis_mode` on the catalog entry (hydrated as `tts_synthesis_mode`). Magpie multilingual and Magpie zeroshot ship with `stitched`; Chatterbox ships with `per_sentence`. Always set the field explicitly so a UI/backend TTS switch cannot inherit another model's mode through the registry-default fallback in the pipeline.

### Word-Level Input Streaming and Timestamps

> **NIM only.** `NvidiaWordTTSService` supports Magpie served by NVIDIA NIM. It does not support the GGML/GGUF-based NeMo-Speech.cpp backend used by `*/single-gpu` profiles.

All examples use Pipecat's `NvidiaTTSService` by default, which keeps Magpie Multilingual, Magpie Zeroshot, and Chatterbox switchable through the service catalog. For Magpie TTS Multilingual NIM 1.10.0 or newer, [`NvidiaWordTTSService`](../../src/examples/shared/nvidia_word_tts.py) is an optional drop-in subclass that adds word-level input streaming and timestamp-based LLM context commits. It requires `nvidia-riva-client>=2.27.0,<3`.

To opt in for a custom example, change only the service import and constructor:

```python
# Default
from pipecat.services.nvidia.tts import NvidiaTTSService

tts = NvidiaTTSService(**tts_kwargs)

# Opt in to Magpie 1.10.0+ word streaming and timestamp commits
from examples.shared.nvidia_word_tts import NvidiaWordTTSService

tts = NvidiaWordTTSService(**tts_kwargs)
```

`NvidiaWordTTSService` internally selects token aggregation, disables parent text-frame commits, uses stitched synthesis, and requests word timestamps. Do not set `text_aggregation_mode` or `push_text_frames` in the example. It also sets Magpie's `max_chunk_threshold` to 100 characters so a long input can be flushed before end of stream.

The UI renders assistant bubbles from LLM response events, independently of the selected TTS service. Word timestamps control when spoken text is committed to LLM context; they do not drive the displayed assistant response.

#### Known Magpie Limitations

- **Word timestamps are delayed until a flush.** Magpie returns timing metadata only after the end of the stream or the configured 100-character threshold. Before that flush, interruption handling cannot calculate the words already played or support progressive highlighting.
- **`meta.words` does not preserve spacing.** `response.meta.words` removes leading and trailing spaces and omits space-only tokens. Because a token may also be a subword or punctuation, clients cannot reliably reconstruct the original spoken text: inserting spaces can produce false gaps such as `"I'm Nem otron ,"`, while concatenating tokens can produce text such as `"IamNemotron,createdbyNVIDIA."`. `NvidiaWordTTSService` currently inserts spaces between timed tokens for readable context, so these false gaps are an expected limitation.

### Pronunciation (IPA)

Override Magpie's default pronunciation for specific words with an International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) dictionary. Create a JSON or YAML dictionary file, then set `TTS_IPA_FILE_PATH` in `.env` to that path. Relative paths resolve from the repo root:

```bash
TTS_IPA_FILE_PATH=config/ipa.json
```

Example dictionary:

```json
{
  "NVIDIA": "ˈɛnˌvɪdiə",
  "GreenForce": "ɡriːn fɔrs",
  "API": "eɪ piː aɪ"
}
```

The dictionary loads at session start and applies to every TTS request. Restart the server (or re-apply the active Compose profile) after changing the file. For the dictionary format and the phonemes Magpie supports, see [TTS customization](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/customization.html) and [phoneme support](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/phoneme-support.html).

> **Check the wiring.** `TTS_IPA_FILE_PATH` only takes effect if the pipeline loads the dictionary and passes it to the `NvidiaTTSService`. The shipped examples do this with `custom_dictionary=load_ipa_dictionary()` where they construct the service (see the `NvidiaTTSService(...)` call in [`src/examples/generic/pipeline.py`](../../src/examples/generic/pipeline.py)). If you build a custom pipeline, confirm your `NvidiaTTSService(...)` is created with `custom_dictionary=load_ipa_dictionary()`, or the env var has no effect.

### TTS Text Filter

LLM output frequently contains Markdown emphasis and characters the Magpie preprocessor reserves for its own markup. Unfiltered, these are spoken literally, make synthesis fail, or produce odd audio. A text filter sits between the LLM and TTS and strips them before synthesis. The default filter removes:

- **`*`**: Markdown emphasis markers (for example `**bold**` and `*italic*`).
- **`{` and `}`**: ARPAbet phoneme tokens such as `{@AW1}`.
- **`<tag>`**: SSML tags parsed by the TTS engine.

These appear naturally in code, JSON, Markdown, or HTML output. The filter classes live in [`src/examples/shared/nemotron_speech_text_filter.py`](../../src/examples/shared/nemotron_speech_text_filter.py):

#### `NemotronSpeechTextFilter` (default)

A single regex pass that strips `*`, `{`, `}`, and tag-opening `<`. Everything else passes through unchanged: comparison operators (`5 < 7`), currency, emoji, and non-Latin scripts. Use it for plain or lightly formatted prose.

```python
# src/examples/generic/pipeline.py
from examples.shared.nemotron_speech_text_filter import NemotronSpeechTextFilter

tts = NvidiaTTSService(
    ...
    text_filters=[NemotronSpeechTextFilter()],  # default
)
```

#### `NemotronSpeechMarkdownTextFilter`

Extends Pipecat's `MarkdownTextFilter` with the same reserved-character strip. Use it when the LLM streams Markdown. All `MarkdownTextFilter` settings (`filter_code`, `filter_tables`) are inherited.

```python
# src/examples/generic/pipeline.py
from examples.shared.nemotron_speech_text_filter import NemotronSpeechMarkdownTextFilter

tts = NvidiaTTSService(
    ...
    text_filters=[NemotronSpeechMarkdownTextFilter()],
)
```

### Text Normalization

Text normalization (TN) rewrites written forms such as numbers, currency, and dates into spoken words before synthesis. Without it, TTS can read `12,50 €` digit by digit or skip it entirely.

The Multilingual Assistant example normalizes text in the pipeline before it reaches TTS. `LanguageAwareVoiceFormatter` in [`src/examples/shared/tts_text_normalizer.py`](../../src/examples/shared/tts_text_normalizer.py) selects a chain from the session TTS language:

- **English (`en`)**: Pipecat's `VoiceFormatter` strips Markdown and expands emails, US phone numbers, dates, currency, percentages, and units.
- **French (`fr`)**: French transforms in [`src/examples/shared/tts_text_transforms_fr.py`](../../src/examples/shared/tts_text_transforms_fr.py) expand currency (`12,50 €` to "douze euros cinquante"), percentages (`25 %`), units (`3,5 km`), ISO and `DD/MM/YYYY` dates, times (`15h30` or `15:30`), French phone numbers read in pairs, and emails. They also remove space and non-breaking space thousands separators (`1 234` to `1234`). Plain integers and ordinals such as `1er` and `2e` pass through to the TTS service's own normalization.
- **Other languages**: Text passes through unchanged.

Both chains leave acronyms as written, so `NVIDIA` is not spelled out letter by letter.

Only the text sent to TTS changes. The transcript and the LLM context keep the original text. The formatter applies to every Multilingual Assistant deployment, cloud and local. To turn it off, set the following value in `.env`:

```bash
TTS_TEXT_NORMALIZATION=false
```

The default is `true`. The other examples do not register this formatter.

On `*/single-gpu`, the NeMo-Speech.cpp server also applies its own Sparrowhawk grammars from `tn_configs`. The v0.1.0 archive contains only `en` and `fr` grammars, and the French grammar is partial. It misses decimal currency, `15h30`-style times, and units, which the pipeline formatter covers. For German, Spanish, Italian, and other languages, the server can silently drop digits and currency symbols. Prompt the LLM to write numbers as words in those languages.

### Voice Cloning / Zero-Shot

Magpie TTS Zeroshot clones a voice from a short reference clip using Pipecat's `NvidiaTTSService(zero_shot_audio_prompt_file=...)`. Set the path only in catalog YAML (`services.local.yaml`); it is not accepted from the client session body. Refer to [voice cloning](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/tts/voice-cloning.html) for details.

1. Enable the Zeroshot sidecar and select `magpie-zeroshot-tts` (see [Hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements-and-deployment-configs)).
2. Prepare a 16-bit mono WAV (sample rate ≥ 22.05 kHz, about 3–10 seconds).
3. In the example's `services.local.yaml` (`server`), keep or set `voice_id` to a built-in such as `Magpie-ZeroShot-Multilingual.Female`, and add an **absolute path visible to the voice-agent process**:

   ```yaml
   magpie-zeroshot-tts:
     ...
     zero_shot_audio_prompt_file: "/data/prompts/clone.wav"
   ```

   - **Host-native** (`uv run` / local Python): use a host absolute path (for example `/home/you/prompts/clone.wav`).
   - **Compose / Docker**: mount the file into the app service for your Compose profile (for example `generic-assistant` with `--profile generic-assistant`, or `generic-assistant-server` with `--profile generic-assistant/server`). Use a Compose override, then set `zero_shot_audio_prompt_file` to that **container** absolute path. Relative paths are not resolved from the repo root.

     ```yaml
     # docker-compose.override.yaml (example for --profile generic-assistant)
     services:
       generic-assistant:
         volumes:
           - /home/you/prompts/clone.wav:/data/prompts/clone.wav:ro
     ```

   The catalog field is hydrated as `tts_zero_shot_audio_prompt_file` and passed into `NvidiaTTSService`.
4. Start a session.

Omit `zero_shot_audio_prompt_file` to use only built-in Zeroshot voices.
